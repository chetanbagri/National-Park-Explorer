## Summary of Process Improvements
Based on the team's process and best practice scores, what process aspects will be changed? Explain why these changes will address the problem.
- There were some points lost for TDD since there was some confusion about each method requiring a test, rather than each file. To improve, we will make sure that a second team member double checks that the first team member has test methods for all their code, before it is committed. This will address the problem since it will avoid future confusion and ensure that TDD is always practiced.
- There were some points lost for refactors, due to an issue being closed by a non-assignee. For sprint 4 we will make sure that each assignee is responsible for closing their respective issues, by texting in the group chat once we do so. This will address the problem since it will hold each team member accountable for smaller tasks like this one.
- There were some points lost for refactors, due to an issue being handled by a non-assignee regarding the API. For this we plan to submit a regrade request since we did fix the issue with clarification from the professor.


## Summary of Sprint Review Feedback
Based on the results of the Sprint Review, what tasks will be added to the product backlog as a result of review feedback?
- Based on the results of our Sprint Review, we will continue to add TDD on each commit we make to the main branch to get full points for each feature.
- We will focus on finishing up features five and six, and also work on completing the errors/missing subfeatures for any features we have left.
- We will also continue to work on making the website look cleaner and more presentable.
- We will continue to make sure to write more descriptive use cases for our feature files, in order to test each sub feature accurately.
