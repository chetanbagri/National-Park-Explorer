## Summary of Process Improvements
Based on the team's process and best practice scores, what process aspects will be changed? Explain why these changes will address the problem.
- We made fatal errors in TDD and Implementation due to our misinterpetation of instructions and how to effectively utilize RE with our stakeholder.
- We will be focusing more on meeting TDD requirements by ensuring scenarios and tests are developed first, then only commit backend/frontend code if it is properly tested.
- Fix our backend test coverage to get higher coverage with less errors and on the first run, rather than the second.
- Conduct better RE by using more time with our stakeholder to ask extremely detailed questions so we gain more implementation points.
- Diversify team members to different features to reduce waiting/blockers from other teammates.
- We believe these changes will address our problems within Sprint 1 as we have a better understanding of what we are expected to do, and new steps to ensure that we don't accidentally gain further deductions on TDD or Implementation.


## Summary of Sprint Review Feedback
Based on the results of the Sprint Review, what tasks will be added to the product backlog as a result of review feedback?
- We have added many sub-requirements we discovered during the Spring Review to our Product Backlog such as adding a colorful, prominent logo on the login page.
- We will also start working on specific sub-features of the searching page and general UI.
- Additionally, we will start implementing sub-features of the security requirement as we have some of the foundation complete needed for that, such as the login page.
