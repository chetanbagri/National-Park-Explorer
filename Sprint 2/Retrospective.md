## Summary of Process Improvements
Based on the team's process and best practice scores, what process aspects will be changed? Explain why these changes will address the problem.
- We had no negative deductions this sprint due to our improvements from Sprint 1.
- Continue conducting better RE by using more time with our stakeholder to ask extremely detailed questions so we gain more implementation points. Also, we will make sure to check in with our stakeholder a second time in order to verify we have the correct scenarios and UI. 
- We will make sure to write more descriptive use cases for our feature files, in order to test each sub feature accurately.
- We will continue working on the main pages of the web app in order to catch up on implementation points.

## Summary of Sprint Review Feedback
Based on the results of the Sprint Review, what tasks will be added to the product backlog as a result of review feedback?
- We will continue practicing TDD on every commit and on every branch to ensure we get all points for that category.
- We will also focus on finishing up the search feature due to our stakeholder advising us to do so. 
- Focus on writing detailed scenarios in the feature file so the grader can award implementation points appropriately 
- We will begin working on new features and sub-requirements such as sharing parks with friends and adding to favorites.
